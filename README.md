# Bank Loan Classification

A bank wants to automate their loan approval process.  They have provided a semi anonymized dataset containing 606 successful and 76 not successful loans along with their information and transactions.

These loans are for existing clients. This could be used to pre approve existing customers and market to them accordingly.
